    <p>
      Hey, I’m <strong>YoungGallop</strong> — a forward-thinking creative with a love for design,
      technology, and meaningful digital storytelling.
    </p>

    <p>
      I specialize in crafting sleek, smart, and user-first experiences that blend form and function
      with a spark of originality.
    </p>

    <div class="values">
      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Pushing boundaries to find new angles and better solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Showing up, delivering, and doing the work that matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Staying true to myself and the story behind every design.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      From web interfaces to interactive experiences, I thrive at the intersection of design and innovation —
      where ideas come to life with purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m always open to new challenges, meaningful collaborations, and projects that aim higher. If you’re into that too,
      let’s connect and make something great.
